# The app
The app is for the bidding event that happens after all the organizations finish building their shacks.

Users have the ability to **place bids** on the app and **monitor** the status of the auction live.

Once they have been **outbid, they will get a noficiation** letting them know.

Backend is hosted on Parse.
